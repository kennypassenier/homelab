# HOST Features (Current)

Last updated: 2026-05-28

## Scope

- Headless daemon responsibilities:
- Proxmox LXC lifecycle operations.
- Host-side storage operations.
- Host-side hardware passthrough operations (GPU/TUN).
- Backup execution endpoints and event streaming.
- Runtime storage health inspection surfaced in HOST Storage tab.
- Runtime hardware readiness + per-stack intent reconciliation surfaced in HOST Hardware tab.
- Boot policy reconciliation (preview/apply) from stack `lxc-compose.yml` intent.
- Hot-applicable CPU/memory reconciliation (preview/apply) from stack `lxc-compose.yml` intent.

## Contract with CLIENT

- HOST is invoked by CLIENT APIs.
- CLIENT remains orchestration owner for multi-step flows.
- HOST emits status/events for CLIENT rendering.

## Backup Policy Enforcement

- HOST now runs a continuous backup policy enforcer loop.
- The enforcer reads `~/.config/homelab/backup-schedule.json` and triggers interval-based backup cycles.
- Scheduled cycles enforce restic retention (`forget --prune`) using daily/weekly/monthly policy values.
- Overlapping manual/scheduled cycles are prevented through a guarded single-cycle lock.

## Release-Based Self Update

- HOST supports release-based self-update, not per-push updates.
- Update checks target GitHub Releases latest tag and compare against local binary version.
- On update availability, HOST downloads the release asset, atomically replaces the local executable, and requests a service restart.

## GPU Clarification

- GPU passthrough cannot be offloaded to LXC runtime.
- It requires host-level modifications to Proxmox LXC config and host device access rules.
- CLIENT-side hardware.gpu in lxc-compose is an orchestration hint for HOST execution.

## Reconciliation Controls

- `o` / `O`: preview/apply boot policy reconciliation.
- `h` / `H`: preview/apply hot-applicable CPU+memory reconciliation.
